# xkcd

Created a Swift UI project to fetch xkcd comics. Here I've designed a cards stack layout which displays comics one at a time and user can swipe either way to see the next comic and also see more details tapping on the info button.
Architecure used  - MVVM
Database - Core Data

The plan of design was simple - To fetch a batch of comics to display to the user and when the user reaches the end of the list fetch the next batch. User can favourite by swiping up and going to info page and pressing the star button.

Future improvements - 1. Adding a screen to display favourites saved
2. Search Screen
3. Adding UI and unit testing
